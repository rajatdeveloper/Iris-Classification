# Iris-Classification
The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher.
The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimetres. Based on the combination of these four features, here we developed a "multivariate linear regression" model to distinguish the species from each other.
The columns in this dataset are:
    Id
    SepalLengthCm
    SepalWidthCm
    PetalLengthCm
    PetalWidthCm
    Species
